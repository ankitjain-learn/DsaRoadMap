To remove cached files 
1. add in gitignore and execute below commands
2. git rm --cached -r .idea

# Patterns
1. whenever symmetrical pattern comes break into 2 funtions
2. in space , make formula for space , star, space which is 3 inner loop
3. when starting reducing start , take j=0 to n-i or j=n-i your choice
4. make formula based on row number and spaces 
5. pattern 10 and 20 is important as they are 2 ways to do it , one inside one loop opr use 2 loops
    here trick is assign value to space and star and use if else to modify one n reaches halfway point 
6. Last pattern is a trick [pattern]

# Basic {@} Maths
1. count can also be determined by log(number) [base 10] +1 
2. whenever division happens in loop then log will be time complexity
3. reverseNum = rev*10 + lastDigit
4. for printing all factors loop till [square root of n] which is also [i*i<=n]
   (4.1) where one factor is [i] and other [n/i] with catch as [n/i!=i]
5. HCD OF GCF is Euclidean Algorithm with complexity as O(log(min[a,b])) base phi

# Recursion
1. For recursion device a function where fibonacci(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
2. when doing palindrome consider swapping with 2 pointers till equal to n/2
3. swapping can be ignored and only equals check can be made 
4. Base condition is very important in recursion to break the loops
